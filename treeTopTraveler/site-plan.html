      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        When you were a child, did you ever want a treehouse in your backyard?
        Whether you had one or not, treehouses represent childhood freedom,
        exploration, and imagination. I want to reintroduce these feelings to
        the adventurer in all of us, both young and old. My website
        treetoptraveler.com provides people with the opportunity to travel all
        over the world to stay in amazing and beautiful treehouses. The process
        is easy, you simply visit the website and search for a treehouse, based
        on your needs, like location or style. Once booked, you will be able to
        experience the vacation of your childhood dreams, while still enjoying
        the modern comforts of a hotel or bed \& breakfast.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Here at Tree Top Traveler our business is catered to the adventurous
        inner child in all of us, but that’s not all. If you aren’t interested
        in roughing it, our accommodations will meet all the needs of your
        modern sensibilities. Our treehouses come equipped with fully functional
        bathrooms, a kitchen for meal preparation, central heating, air
        conditioning, electricity, even room service; if that’s what you want,
        but if you’re more rough and tumble, we’ve got you covered as well. If
        you are adventurous campers, a newlywed couple, empty nesters, or a
        family still welcoming new additions, check out Tree Top Travelers and
        sleep out under the stars – you won’t be disappointed!

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>Heading Font: Amatic SC</h4>
      <p>
        I think the look of this font will match well with the theme of my site.
        It has clean lines that are largely straight, but have slight curves to
        them, which reminds me of the way that most tree trunks grow. It appears
        somewhat on the small side, so I may have to use larger font to get the
        desired look I want.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Cabin
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because it is very readable at the smaller size of a
        paragraph. It is a sans-serif font with nice wide letters and clean
        lines.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.

        Tree Top Traveler<br />
        <br />We provide tree house rentals for Business, Rest, Relaxation,
        Enjoyment, Culture, Whimsey, Food, Fancy, Fun… and so much more. Come
        and see what we have to offer.<br />
        <br />Our tree houses range from single room studio apartments to
        multi-tiered, penthouse villas on stilts. Hey, we could probably argue
        that every listing we offer comes as a penthouse suite, but we won’t.
        What we will say, is that if you decide to stay with us, no matter which
        of our listings you may choose to stay in, you are guaranteed fresh air,
        peaceful surroundings, and inspiring scenic views.<br />
        <br />Philosophy<br />
        <br />Tree Top Traveler was started by a group of friends who wanted to
        provide customers with comfortable accommodations from any location in
        the world – provided there are trees nearby. However, they felt like the
        typical room and board situation had been so overused by the motel,
        hotel, and bnb crowd that it was time to change things up, which is why
        they decided that Tree Top Traveler would specialize in providing its
        customers with convenient, modern, affordable tree house rentals to meet
        their varied needs for travel and adventure. Thus, Tree Top Traveler was
        born.<br />
        <br />Operations<br />
        <br />While Tree Top Traveler does maintain and operate many tree house
        properties across the United States, we have also partnered with
        professionals and private citizens to offer similar accommodations from
        varied locations throughout the world. These partnerships ensure that
        you can expect to enjoy the same level of professionalism and care from
        any location that is offered by Tree Top Traveler.<br />
        <br />Safety<br />
        <br />Before any tree house property is listed on Tree Top Traveler, it
        goes through a series of rigorous inspections to ensure that it meets
        the safety standards required by local, national, and state building
        codes, as well Tree Top Traveler’s own extensive safety rules
        established and patterned after the US Housing and Securities Board. If
        you have any concerns, our staff is available on our website 24/7 to
        meet your needs, and answer your questions regarding the safety of
        properties operated by ourselves or any of our partners.
